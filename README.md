# ManOverboard
Collaborated with SWE Team Tech on the Crew Overboard Alarm System Project sponsored by Lockheed Martin in the locations/tracking subgroup. Developed an iOS application for tracking a man overboard in Swift. (Code can run in xcode simulation, but is not connected to receive outside information currently.)
